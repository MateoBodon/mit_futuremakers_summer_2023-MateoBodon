# Pandas

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Pandas
* Tabular Data
* Operations on Tabular data

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* I see Pandas and Dataframes to be very powerful and very applicable. When dealing with thousands or millions of data points, being able to sort, merge, and filter is huge.
* I believe I will be using Pandas a lot more in the near future, in this repo, and in future projects.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* I found the trickiest part about this assignment is finding the best way to complete each task. There is a delicate balance between efficiency and readability. For example, while something may be accomplishable in one line, it may be easier for you and others to read your code to break apart your operations.
* On another note, each question can be solved in various ways and researching on Google, and the Documentation is important for resource management and efficiency.

## Additional resources used 
* I used the Pandas documentation for a lot of the questions.
* I also used ChatGPT to learn about specific functions and potential uses.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundametals. The notes are a compilation of course provided notes and ones of my own.
* Also after solving problems I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
