# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Understanding the role of TensorFlow as a powerful library for numerical computation, specifically for large-scale Machine Learning.
* Successfully building a simple neural network model and understanding the role of each layer in the model.
* Learning how to preprocess data for feeding into the neural network.
* Making predictions using the trained model and evaluating its performance.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* It was very challenging figuring out what things meant and what they did in terms of the model.
* The visualization of the model's predictions was exciting as it provided a visual representation of the model's performance.
* Understanding the nuances of different activation functions and optimizers was an interesting part of the assignment.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundametals. The notes are a compilation of course-provided notes and ones of my own.
* After solving problems, I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However, the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
