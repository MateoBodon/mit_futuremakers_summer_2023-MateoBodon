# Convolution Neural Network

## Topics covered in today's module
* Convolution neural network components
* Visualizing kernels
* Visualizing feature maps
* Pooling
* Dropout
* Batch norm

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* The CNN architecture includes various components such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout, and batch normalization.
* Visualizations of kernels and feature maps provide an in-depth understanding of how CNNs extract features from input images.
* Non-linear activation functions, like ReLU help the network learn complex patterns within the data.
* Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training, while batch normalization helps speed up learning and improve generalization.


## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* Building my own CNN model was tricky but useful in improving my understanding of CNNs
* The visualizations of kernels and feature maps offer an interesting view into the inner workings of the CNN model.
* Seeing firsthand how we can improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting with dropout and batch normalization was fascinating.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundamentals. The notes are a compilation of course-provided notes and ones of my own.
* After solving problems, I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However, the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
