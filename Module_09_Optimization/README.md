# Classification Loss Functions

## Topics covered in today's module
* Kullback Leibler Divergence Loss
* Binary Cross-Entropy
* Categorical Cross-Entropy
* Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Detailed understanding of the four major classification loss functions: Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss, Binary Cross-Entropy, Categorical Cross-Entropy, and Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy.
* Learned the theory behind the loss functions, their derivations, and use cases, which enhances my understanding of when and where to apply each loss function.
* Gained insights into the role and importance of loss functions in the optimization process in machine learning models.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* Understanding the mathematical theory behind each loss function was challenging but increased my depth of knowledge in the subject.
* Found it exciting to learn about different types of loss functions and their applications in various types of classification problems.
* The process of tuning and observing the effect of changes in parameters was an interesting aspect that provided hands-on learning experience.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundamentals. The notes are a compilation of course-provided notes and ones of my own.
* After solving problems, I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However, the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
