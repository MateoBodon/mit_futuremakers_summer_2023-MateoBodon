# Regularization

## Topics covered in today's module
* L1/L2 Regularization
* Dropout
* Overfitting
* Underfitting

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Gained hands-on experience in implementing L1 and L2 regularization to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.
* Understood the concept of dropout as a regularization technique, specifically in neural networks, to prevent overfitting by randomly ignoring neurons during training.
* Learned to recognize and address overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models, using regularization techniques and adjusting model complexity.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* Experimenting with different regularization parameters was a challenging yet interesting aspect, as it highlighted the importance of these parameters in controlling model complexity.
* The visualization of the effect of L1 and L2 regularization on the coefficients was exciting and provided a clearer understanding of how these techniques work.
* The concept of dropout as a regularization method in neural networks was intriguing, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of neural networks.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundamentals. The notes are a compilation of course-provided notes and ones of my own.
* After solving problems, I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However, the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
