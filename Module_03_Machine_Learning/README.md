# Machine Learning

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Machine learning with Scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Random Forests

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Gained understanding of the difference between Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, and learned how they handle different types of data.
* Learned how to use Scikit-learn to implement Machine Learning models including Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Random Forests.
* Learned about the concept of Gini Index and how it is used in Decision Trees to make decisions.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* It was challenging to be thrown head-first into Machine Learning models without much background. While my understanding has deepened, there are definitely still holes.
* Implementing and understanding the difference between Decision Trees and Linear Regression models was an exciting part of the assignment. It was fascinating to see how different models can be used to solve the same problem.
* The process of deciding which model fits best for the given data was an interesting exercise. It required an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each model type.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundametals. The notes are a compilation of course provided notes and ones of my own.
* Also after solving problems I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
