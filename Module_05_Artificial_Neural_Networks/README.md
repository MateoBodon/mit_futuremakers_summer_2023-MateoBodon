# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Experimented with hyperparameters, gaining insights into their role in shaping the learning process and the performance of the neural network.
* Implemented the forward pass, understanding the role of activation functions like sigmoid and softmax.
* Overcame the challenge of implementing backpropagation, learning how the network adjusts its weights based on errors.
* Computed the accuracy of the model on a validation set, learning to gauge model performance.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* It can be really challenging navigating through the notebooks with the large variety of concepts and terms presented. 
* Grasping the concept of backpropagation was initially tricky but after tome further reading it became more clear.
* Working with various activation functions like sigmoid, softmax, and ReLU was an intriguing exercise. It was interesting to see how functions like these can help our models.

* I also used ChatGPT frequently for this module to help explain terms that were less familiar to me.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundamentals. The notes are a compilation of course-provided notes and ones of my own.
* After solving problems, I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However, the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
