# NumPy

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to NumPy
* Arrays/Matrices
* Matrix operations

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* I was alredy familiar with Numpy from a Data Science Course I took, so this assignment was a good refresher. However I did learn a lot more about matrices and matrix operations.
* I also learned a few new NumPy functions that I didn't know about before. For example `np.concatenate` and `np.linalg.matrix_rank`.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* Matrix operations are pretty new to me so I had to do some external research to really understand the topic. However now I thik I have a good grasp on the topic.
* I also had some trouble visualizing matrix ranks so I asked ChatGPT for some examples. I think I understand it now.
* Question 4 was also a bit confusing in the sense of what the question was asking. After playing around with the code I achieved the desired result.


## Additional resources used 
* Numpy Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html
* Matrix Operations: https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/algebra/linear-algebra/matrix-algebra/operations-with-matrices
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundametals. The notes are a compilation of course provided notes and ones of my own.
* Also after solving problems I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
