## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* I had some issues with question number 2. At first it was a little unclear to me what needed to be done, but after figuring it out I kept running into a type error regarding my initilization. After scratching my head for quite a while I realized I forgot the parenthesis in my `super()` call.

## Additional resources used 
* ChatGPT taught me about the 'isinstance' function which turned out to be really helpful for question 1.
* I have a Folder of notes on Python that I refer to a lot. It includes pretty much all the Python Fundametals. The notes are a compilation of course provided notes and ones of my own.
* Also after solving problems I commonly ask ChatGPT about my solution to see how it can be improved or done differently. However the answers provided in the notebook represent my original attempt.
